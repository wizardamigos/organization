# MANIFESTO

# Our vision and core values

## Literacy
  * Programming (coding) is a new literacy. All the jobs in the future will include some level of programming.
  * We mentor new wizards to become literate in developing and deploying solutions for tomorrow.
  * We encourage wizards to later organize learning sessions themselves - once they feel ready.

## Inclusiveness
  * Wizard Amigos Institute connects all genders, backgrounds, experience levels & age in an open and safe learning environment with a playful atmosphere.
  * We support the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/) and humble & friendly communication, so no one feels shy asking any questions.
  * Help us to maximize inclusion! [Donate](https://gratipay.com/pleaseDropUsAnEmailInstead) to support our Pay-what-you-can programme.

## Makers' "Do It Yourself" Spirit
  * Visible progress is the best motivator for continuous learning so wizards are encouraged to kickstart their own projects.
  * We teach wizards quick organized prototyping to empower local entrepreneurial thinking and a hands-on approach.
  * Prototypes are then constantly tested and based on the feedback new improvements are done in each iteration.

## Open Culture of Collaboration
  * We introduce wizards to different state-of-the-art tools & methods for self-directed collaboration.
  * Individuals are then encouraged to collaborate on projects & to invite others to join their projects.

## Open Source & Sharing
  * We create a knowledge sharing movement to spread the new literacy.
  * New wizards share progress and questions openly to inspire others and to get feedback from their peers.
  * All our learning materials are also available for free and we hope for an open debate and contributions from the community.

## Open Organisation & Transparency
  * Our processes, finances and organization are completely transparent.
  * We develop support networks for changemakers to go on and create open incubators elsewhere using our model.
  * Please get in touch. [Open issues](https://github.com/wizardamigosinstitute/discussion/issues) and let us know what are your thoughts on our values. Debate, ask us or share your ideas. We are happy to hear your opinion or help you with more information.
