# Our vision and core values

## Literacy
  * Programming (coding) is a new literacy. All the jobs in the future will include some level of programming.
  * We mentor new wizards to become literate in developing and deploying solutions for tomorrow.
  * We encourage new wizards to later organize learning sessions themselves - once they feel ready.

## Inclusiveness
  * Wizard Amigos Institute connects all genders, backgrounds, experience levels & age in an open and safe learning environment with a playful atmosphere.
  * We support the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/) and humble & friendly communication, so no one feels shy asking any questions.
  * Help us to maximize inclusion! [Donate](https://gratipay.com/pleaseDropUsAnEmailInstead) to support our Pay-what-you-can programme. 

## Makers' "Do It Yourself" Spirit
  * Visible progress is the best motivator for continuous learning. Wizards are encouraged to kickstart their own projects.
  * We teach wizards quick organized prototyping to empower local entrepreneurial thinking and a hands-on approach.    * Prototypes are constantly tested and based on the feedback new improvements are done in each iteration. 

## Open Culture of Collaboration
  * During learning sessions new wizards co-create projects.
  * They are introduced to different state-of-the-art tools & methods for self-directed collaboration.

## Open Source & Sharing
  * We create a knowledge sharing movement to spread the new literacy.
  * New wizards share progress and questions openly to inspire others and to get feedback from their peers.
  * All our learning materials are also available for free and we hope for an open debate and contributions from the  community.

## Open Organisation & Transparency
  * Our processes, finances and organization are completely transparent.
  * We develop support networks for changemakers to go on and create open incubators elsewhere using our model.
  * Please get in touch. Let us know what are your thoughts on our values. Ask us what was unclear. Debate. We are happy to help you with more information.
